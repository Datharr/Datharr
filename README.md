Effortlessly ingest FA descriptions from meticulously formatted text files. The system dynamically constructs and visualizes:
- **Initial States**: The starting configurations of the automaton.
- **Terminal States**: The designated accepting states.
- **Transition Matrix**: A detailed mapping of state transitions based on input symbols.

### 2. Determinism and Completeness Analysis

Evaluate and transform the FA to meet rigorous computational standards:
- **Deterministic Verification**: Ascertain whether the FA adheres to deterministic principles.
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure all possible transitions are defined for deterministic FAs.
- **Standardization**: Convert non-standard FAs into their standard forms.

### 3. Transformation Algorithms

Apply sophisticated algorithms to refine the automaton:
- **Determinization**: Convert non-deterministic FAs to deterministic ones.
- **Completion**: Extend deterministic FAs to cover all potential transitions.
- **Minimization**: Optimize the FA by merging equivalent states and reducing complexity.

### 4. Advanced Features

- **Word Recognition**: Test and validate word acceptance by the automaton.
- **Language Complementation**: Generate and analyze an automaton for the complement of the original language.

- **Solver Algorithm**: Solve Takuzu puzzles using a built-in algorithm that finds a solution or verifies the puzzle's validity.

- **Constraints**: Ensure that the generated puzzles follow the Takuzu rules:
  - Each row and column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.
  - No more than two identical numbers should be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - No two rows or columns should be identical.


# 📝 Exquisite Corpse Generator 📝

<p align="justify">This C program retrieves half a million lines from a French language dictionary and stores them in a tree data structure, where each node represents a letter (using a **trie**). The program then uses this dictionary to generate French sentences for the "Cadavre Exquis" game, a surrealist writing game, according to three predefined sentence models.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/Datharr/Datharr/blob/main/assets/trie.png" alt="Actual Gameplay" style="float: right; width: 350px; height: auto; margin-left: 20px;"/>

### Features

- **Efficient Tree Data Structure**: The program uses a **trie** to store and manage the dictionary, optimizing both memory usage and lookup times.
- **Memory Management**: Optimized memory handling using `malloc`, ensuring that the program can handle large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Sentence Generation**: The program can generate grammatically correct French sentences based on three distinct models:
  - **Model 1**: `Noun - Adjective - Verb - Noun`
  - **Model 2**: `Noun - "qui" - Verb - Verb - Noun - Adjective`
  - **Model 3**: `Verb - Adverb - Noun - Adjective`
- **Extensive Codebase**: The program consists of over 1000 lines of code, structured for readability and maintainability with professional standards.
